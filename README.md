# Things coded on the [clumsy computer stream](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer)

clumsy computer is a channel where we code things from scratch to understand
programming better! We've built things from a regular expression engine to an
OCR implementation live on stream, usually with no imports or libraries.

This repository contains the code for all the things that we coded on [the
stream](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer) and in [the
videos](https://video.clumsy.computer).

If you find it interesting, please stop by the stream, we'd love to have you around! There's
currently no schedule, so you can follow [twitch.tv/clumsycomputer](https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer)
and you'll be notified when it's live!
